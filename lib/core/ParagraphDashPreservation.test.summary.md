# Paragraph Dash Preservation Test Suite Summary

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite was created to address **Task 1** from the paragraph-dash-preservation specification: "Улучшить существующие тесты для сохранения тире в начале абзаца".

## Test Coverage

### 1. Basic Dash Preservation (4 tests)
- **Em-dash preservation**: Tests that em-dashes (—) at paragraph start are preserved
- **En-dash conversion**: Tests that en-dashes (–) are converted to em-dashes
- **Hyphen-minus conversion**: Tests that regular hyphens (-) are converted to em-dashes
- **Double hyphen conversion**: Tests that double hyphens (--) are converted to em-dashes

### 2. Edge Cases with Whitespace (6 tests)
- **Multiple spaces before dash**: Handles various amounts of leading whitespace
- **Tabs before dash**: Preserves tab characters in poetry-like structures
- **NBSP before dash**: Handles non-breaking spaces before dashes
- **Multiple spaces after dash**: Normalizes multiple spaces after dashes to single space
- **NBSP after dash**: Handles non-breaking spaces after dashes
- **Mixed whitespace**: Complex combinations of different whitespace types

### 3. Complex Paragraph Structures (3 tests)
- **Multiple paragraphs**: Handles multiple paragraphs with dashes and empty lines
- **Mixed content**: Handles documents with both dash-prefixed and regular paragraphs
- **Nested quotes**: Handles dashes with quoted content and proper quote conversion

### 4. Unicode Dash Variants (4 tests)
- **Unicode em-dash (U+2014)**: Direct Unicode em-dash character
- **Unicode en-dash (U+2013)**: Direct Unicode en-dash character
- **Unicode minus (U+2212)**: Mathematical minus sign
- **Figure dash (U+2012)**: Figure dash character

### 5. Regression Tests for Dash Disappearance (4 tests)
- **Final cleanup phase**: Critical test ensuring dashes don't disappear during final processing
- **Complex whitespace patterns**: Tests the specific patterns that were causing issues
- **Specific failing case**: Reproduces the exact scenario that was reported as failing
- **Deduplication compatibility**: Ensures dash preservation works with text deduplication

### 6. Performance and Edge Cases (4 tests)
- **Very long text**: Tests with 100 lines of dash-prefixed content
- **Empty lines between dashes**: Handles multiple empty paragraphs
- **Document boundaries**: Tests dashes at start and end of documents
- **Single character lines**: Handles minimal content after dashes

### 7. Integration with Other Typography Rules (3 tests)
- **NBSP rules integration**: Ensures dash preservation works with non-breaking space rules
- **Quote conversion integration**: Tests interaction with quote typography rules
- **Number and abbreviation rules**: Tests compatibility with number formatting and abbreviations

### 8. Specific Whitespace Preservation (2 tests)
- **Tab preservation in poetry**: Maintains tab-based indentation structures
- **Leading whitespace normalization**: Proper handling of leading vs trailing whitespace

## Requirements Coverage

The test suite addresses all specified requirements:

### Requirement 1.1 (Dash preservation)
✅ **Covered by**: Basic dash preservation tests, regression tests
- Tests ensure dashes at paragraph start are preserved after processing
- Multiple test cases verify different input scenarios

### Requirement 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (All dash types)
✅ **Covered by**: Basic dash preservation tests, Unicode dash variants
- Em-dash (—), en-dash (–), hyphen-minus (-), double hyphen (--)
- Unicode variants including U+2014, U+2013, U+2212, U+2012

### Requirement 5.1, 5.2 (Testing scenarios)
✅ **Covered by**: All test categories
- Simple cases: Basic dash preservation tests
- Edge cases: Whitespace handling, Unicode variants
- Complex documents: Multiple paragraphs, mixed content, integration tests

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 30
- **Test Categories**: 8
- **Requirements Covered**: 6 out of 6 specified
- **Edge Cases Tested**: 15+
- **Unicode Variants Tested**: 4
- **Regression Tests**: 4

## Key Features Tested

### Critical Functionality
1. **Dash Preservation**: Core requirement that dashes don't disappear
2. **Type Normalization**: Different dash types converted to em-dash
3. **Whitespace Handling**: Proper spacing before and after dashes
4. **Integration Safety**: Works with other typography rules

### Edge Cases
1. **Whitespace Variants**: Spaces, tabs, NBSP, mixed combinations
2. **Unicode Support**: Various Unicode dash characters
3. **Document Structure**: Empty lines, nested content, boundaries
4. **Performance**: Large documents with many dashes

### Regression Prevention
1. **Final Cleanup Phase**: Prevents the specific bug that was occurring
2. **Deduplication Compatibility**: Ensures dashes survive text deduplication
3. **Complex Patterns**: Tests the exact scenarios that were failing

## Test Execution Results

All 30 tests pass successfully, confirming:
- ✅ Dash preservation works correctly
- ✅ All dash types are handled properly
- ✅ Edge cases are covered
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ Integration with other typography rules is maintained

## Implementation Quality

The test suite follows best practices:
- **Descriptive test names**: Clear indication of what each test verifies
- **Comprehensive assertions**: Multiple checks per test where appropriate
- **Debug output**: Strategic logging for troubleshooting
- **Flexible expectations**: Accounts for expected behavior variations
- **Performance considerations**: Tests with large datasets
- **Real-world scenarios**: Based on actual usage patterns

This test suite provides robust protection against the dash disappearance issue and ensures the paragraph dash preservation feature works reliably across all supported scenarios.
